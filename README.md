Project Yarnist aims to tackle the critical issue of yarn quality affecting the final fabric's outcome. By utilizing the Yarnist Inspector, a high-quality capturing device with a faster speed than the running yarn, images of the yarn are automatically captured through a web application with just a single click. These images are then classified based on defects like neps, hairiness, thick and thin places, snarls, and non-defective segments using a trained CNN model. The user-friendly web application facilitates the generation and download of comprehensive quality status reports for the yarn. The system efficiently manages data, allowing for easy clearing of previous images and generating new reports for each new batch of yarn. Going beyond the fundamental approach, Project Yarnist envisions placing the Yarnist Inspector in yarn warehouses with a rewinding mechanism. With cloud-hosted web applications, warehouses worldwide can access the Yarnist system, obtaining valuable reports and contributing data to enhance the CNN model's intelligence. The ultimate vision is to achieve remote certification for yarn quality, revolutionizing the textile industry and ensuring the production of superior fabrics.
